# FundFast
FundFast is my project for the React JS course at SoftUni.

It is a crowdfunding website, inspired by websites like GoFundMe, Indiegogo and Kickstarter.
Its aim is to give the users an easy-to-use platform, where they can raise money for four different types
of causes :
  -#Donations
  -#Campaigns
  -#Product development
  -#Startups
