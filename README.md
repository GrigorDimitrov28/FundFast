# FundFast
FundFast is my project for the React JS course at SoftUni.

It is a crowdfunding website, inspired by websites like GoFundMe, Indiegogo and Kickstarter.
Its aim is to give the users an easy-to-use platform, where they can raise money for four different types
of causes :
  ###     Donations
  ###     Campaigns
  ###     Product development
  ###     Startups
  
Future goals for the project are: 
  ###       Translate to Bulgarian
  ###       Improve the design and functionality
  ###       Adapt the website to use real money
  ###       Launch and become the biggest crowdfunding website in Bulgaria

How to run the website: 
  # In the main folder: 
    ## npm install
    ## npm run start
  # In the api folder: 
    ## npm install
    ## npm run start
    
FundFast provides the following functionality: 
  ### Adding personal fundraisers and blog posts
