# FundFast
FundFast is my project for the React JS course at SoftUni.

It is a crowdfunding website, inspired by websites like GoFundMe, Indiegogo and Kickstarter.
Its aim is to give the users an easy-to-use platform, where they can raise money for four different types
of causes (Donations, Campaigns, Product development, Startups)
  
Future goals for the project are: 
  ###  -Translate to Bulgarian
  ###  -Improve the design and functionality
  ###  -Adapt the website to use real money
  ###  -Launch and become the biggest crowdfunding website in Bulgaria

How to run the website: 
  # In the main folder: 
    ## npm install
    ## npm run start
  # In the api folder: 
    ## npm install
    ## npm run start
    
FundFast provides the following functionality: 
  ### -Adding personal fundraisers and blog posts
  ### -Adjusting account settings and depositing virtual money
  ### -Donating money and liking different fundraisers
  ### -Managing own fundraisers
  ### -Adding comments to other people's blog posts
  ### -Tracking own and website's statistic
